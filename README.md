#### Hirschberg + Needleman-Wursch

This code takes two sequences and outputs an optimal alignment in addition to the time taken. It implements a scoring function where matches are scored 1 more than mismatches/gaps.

To run, follow these commands OR run as you typically would any C++ file. If that does not work, feel free to use an online compiler. This was written on macos using clang. 

```
make hirschberg && ./hirschberg

OR 

make needleman && ./needleman
```

To change sequence input, edit input.txt.
